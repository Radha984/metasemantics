                <summary><b>How to cook Chicken fry</b></summary><br><br>
                Cooking chicken fry can be a delicious and straightforward process. Here’s a step-by-step guide to making crispy, flavorful chicken fry:<br><br>
           <h1> Ingredients</h1>

- <b>Chicken</b>: 1 kg (preferably bone-in pieces like thighs or drumsticks)<br><br>
-<b>Buttermil</b>: 1 cup (optional, for marinating)<br><br>
- <b>Flour</b>: 1 cup<br><br>
- <b>Cornstarch</b>: 1/2 cup<br><br>
- <b>Eggs </b>: 2, beaten<br><br>
- <b>Breadcrumbs</b>: 1 cup (optional, for extra crunch)<br><br>
- <h3>Spices:</h3> 
  - 1 tablespoon paprika<br><br>
  - 1 teaspoon garlic powder<br><br>
  - 1 teaspoon onion powder<br><br>
  - 1 teaspoon dried thyme or oregano<br><br>
  - 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional, for heat)<br><br>
  - Salt and pepper to taste<br><br>
    <b>Oil: </b>For frying (vegetable oil or canola oil works well)<br><br>
     <b>Lemon juice:</b> 1 tablespoon (optional, for flavor)<br><br>
       <b>Garlic cloves: </b>2, minced (optional, for extra flavor)<br><br>

    <h3>Equipment</h3>

- Large mixing bowls
- Frying pan or deep fryer
- Tongs or a slotted spoon
- Paper towels
- Cooling rack (optional)

<b>Instructions</b>

<h3>Prepare the Chicken</h3>

  <b> 1. Clean and Cut: </b>Rinse the chicken pieces under cold water and pat them dry with paper towels. Cut them into bite-sized pieces if you prefer smaller pieces.<br><br>
   <b>2. Marinate (Optional):</b> For extra tenderness and flavor, marinate the chicken in buttermilk mixed with a tablespoon of lemon juice for at least 1 hour or overnight in the refrigerator. This helps tenderize the chicken and adds flavor.<br><br>

    <h3>2.Prepare the Breading Station</h3>

   1.Mix Flour and Spices: In a large bowl, combine the flour, cornstarch, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, thyme (or oregano), cayenne pepper, salt, and pepper. Mix well.<br><br>
   2. Beat Eggs: In a separate bowl, beat the eggs.
   3. Prepare Breadcrumbs (Optional): If using breadcrumbs, place them in a third bowl.<br><br>

     <h3> 3. Coat the Chicken</h3>

   1. Dredge in Flour Mixture: Take each piece of chicken and dredge it in the flour mixture, coating it evenly. Shake off any excess.<br><br>
   2. Dip in Eggs: Dip the floured chicken piece into the beaten eggs, allowing any excess to drip off.<br><br>
   3. Coat with Breadcrumbs (Optional): If using breadcrumbs, coat the chicken pieces with breadcrumbs after the egg dip for extra crunch.<br><br>
   4. Rest: Place the coated chicken pieces on a plate or tray and let them rest for about 10-15 minutes. This helps the coating adhere better during frying.<br><br>

<h3>4.Heat the Oil</h3>

   1. Heat Oil: In a large frying pan or deep fryer, heat enough oil to submerge the chicken pieces (about 1-2 inches of oil). Heat the oil to 350°F (175°C). You can use a kitchen thermometer to check the temperature.<br><br>
   2. Test Oil: Drop a small piece of the flour mixture into the oil. If it bubbles and rises to the surface, the oil is ready.<br><br>

<h3> 5. Fry the Chicken</h3>

   1. Fry in Batches: Carefully place the chicken pieces into the hot oil, being careful not to overcrowd the pan. Fry in batches if necessary.<br><br>
   2. Cook Until Golden: Fry the chicken pieces for about 8-10 minutes, turning occasionally, until they are golden brown and cooked through. The internal temperature should reach 165°F (74°C).<br><br>
   3. Drain: Use tongs or a slotted spoon to remove the chicken pieces from the oil and place them on a plate lined with paper towels or a cooling rack to drain excess oil.<br><br>

<h3>6. Serve</h3>

   1. Season: While the chicken is still hot, you can season it with a little more salt or your favorite seasoning.<br><br>
   2. Serve Hot: Serve the chicken fry hot with your favorite sides such as mashed potatoes, coleslaw, or a dipping sauce.<br><br>

Enjoy your crispy and flavorful chicken fry!
